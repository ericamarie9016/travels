This is being actively worked on in my spare time while I am a Masters student.\nTo begin, this map explores the locations I have lived in blue and the countries I have visited in purple. Ultimately I will add more details and blog posts to this map, and the filter will be used to combine specific trips (such as looking at all posts from my half year US road trip)."
