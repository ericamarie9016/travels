    "text": "This is my first blog post!\n\nAttached is a photo of an epic adventure I went on in 2020, rafting and canyoneering in the Grand Canyon. I spent several months free after this adventure camping throughout Arizona and California, with no cares in the world [^1] besides finding the best hammock spots! I have switched up my lifestyle going back to graduate school, dressing more like a professional, and am on an adventure of the MIND! It is hard to believe that just several months ago, I was attempting to self-teach programming in my free time and barely had an understanding of the resources available.\n[^1] It’s obvious from my bright clothing choice that I really had no cares in the world…\nWhy did I decide on this degree? This is a newer field, so others might feel unsure of taking a similar leap. I sure was!\nI already have the ecology background (even though there is always more to learn), what I really wanted to gain was the skillset. I originally was speaking to the Director of a Botany master’s, and was considering applying for a PhD. I’m still very curious to learn more on botany, but I spent time speaking with several professors (which I highly recommend you do during your search!) and had some life-changing insights.\nWhat do I think of this program?\n\nI learned in a workshop by Sam Csik (Csik 2022).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCsik, Samantha. 2022. “Adding a Blog to Your Existing Quarto Website.” October 24, 2022. https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dale2022,\n  author = {Erica Dale},\n  title = {Learning How to Make a Blog Post},\n  date = {2022-10-24},\n  url = {http://ericamarie9016.github.io/2022-10-24-first-post},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nErica Dale. 2022. “Learning How to Make a Blog Post.”\nOctober 24, 2022. http://ericamarie9016.github.io/2022-10-24-first-post."
